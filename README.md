# ProbML

## Description
The ProbML tool helps you classify your genomes into probiotic and non-probiotic based on the machine learning models developed by the Systems Biology Lab, IIT Mandi.

## Features
- **ProbML Module**: Classify genomes into probiotics or non-probiotics using in-house trained 12 XGB_LD3_IITMd models.
- **Kmers Module**: Generate a Kmer frequency matrix for training models.
- **Training Module**: Train various ML models using your dataset.
- **Prediction Module**: Classify genomes using the trained models.

## Requirements
