# ProbML

## Description
The ProbML tool helps you classify your genomes into probiotic and non-probiotic based on the machine learning models developed by the Systems Biology Lab, IIT Mandi.

## Features
- **ProbML Module**: Classify genomes using 12 XGB_SB_IITMd models.
- **Kmers Module**: Generate a kmer frequency matrix.
- **Training Module**: Train various ML models using your dataset.
- **Prediction Module**: Classify genomes using the trained models.

## Requirements
- numpy
- pandas
- pillow
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- tkinter
- xgboost

## Installation and usage
1. Ensure you have Python version 3 or higher installed.
2. Install the required dependencies
